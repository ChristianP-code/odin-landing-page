**Odin Landing Page project.**

This is a landing page created from scratch using simple HTML and CSS styling and flexboxes. It's given me skills in:
- Employing separate HTML and CSS sheets
- Using flexboxes to create a page layout that adapts to screen size changes
- CSS code to apply styling like curved buttons.
- Using the developer console to troubleshoot and problem solve, particularly sizing and positioning of flexboxes

It's my first training project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
